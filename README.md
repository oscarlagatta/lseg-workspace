## Development server

Run `nx serve api` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Understand this workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of the projects.

## Remote caching

Run `npx nx connect-to-nx-cloud` to enable [remote caching](https://nx.app) and make CI faster.

## Query

```
  {
    companies {
      id
      name
      brand
      products
    }
  }
```

## Query by Id

```
  {
    company(id: 2) {
      id
      name
      brand

    }
  }
```

## Mutation

```
mutation {
  createCompany(createCompanyInput: {
    name: "Marks & Spencer",
    brand: "Ecommerce",
    products: ["consultancy", "development"]
  }) {
    id,
    name,
    brand,
    products
  }
}
```

## Update Mutation

```
mutation {
  updateCompany(id: 3, updateCompanyInput: {
    name: "Updated"
  }) {
    name
  }
}
```

## Remove Mutation

```
mutation {
  removeCompany(id: 2) {
    name
  }
}
```

## Mutation Create Company Version 2

```
mutation {
  createCompany(createCompanyInput: {
    name: "Marks & Spencer",
    brand: "Ecommerce",
    products: ["consultancy", "development"]
  }) {
    id,
    name,
    brand,
    products {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

## Using GraphQL Interfaces 

```
{
	stocks {
		name
		... on Company {
			brand
		}
	}
}
```

## Using Unions, we need to use inline fragments to be able to query any fields


```
{
	stocks {
		... on StockExchange {
		  name
		}
		... on Company {
		  name
			brand
		}
	}
}
```

## Using Enum Types

```
export enum CompanyType {
  BUSINESS = 'Business',
  GOVERNMENT = 'Government',
  SPORT = 'Sport'
}

registerEnumType(CompanyType, {
  name: 'CompanyType'
})
```

```
mutation {
  createCompany(createCompanyInput: {
    name: "Microsoft Corporation",
    brand: "Ecommerce",
    products: ["consultancy", "development"],
		type: BUSINESS 
  }) {
    id,
    name,
    brand,
    products {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

## Querying The Enum Types
```
{
	__type(name: "CompanyType") {
		enumValues {
			name
		}
	}
}
```

### Result

```
{
	"data": {
		"__type": {
			"enumValues": [
				{
					"name": "BUSINESS"
				},
				{
					"name": "GOVERNMENT"
				},
				{
					"name": "SPORT"
				}
			]
		}
	}
}
```
## Field Middleware

A field middleware can be used to:

- convert the result of a field
- validate the arguments of a field,
- or even to check field-level roles

(for example, a middleware function that checks whether a role is required and allowed to access a target field).
When multiple middleware functions are used, they are actually called sequentially (one after another) following the chain where the previous middleware decides to call the next one.

**Note** - The order in which we have our middleware functions in a middleware array is very important.

The first resolver is the "most-outer" layer, so it gets executed first and last (similarly to how you may have seen it achieved with the graphql-middleware package if you’ve used it before).

The second resolver is the "second-outer" layer, so it gets executed second and second to last.

## Real Time Updates

In addition to fetching data with queries and modifying data with mutations, the GraphQL spec supports a third operation type (that we’ve only hinted at so far), called subscriptions.

GraphQL subscriptions are a way to push data from the server to the clients that want to listen to real time messages from the server.

Subscriptions are similar to queries in that they specify a set of fields to be delivered to the client, but instead of immediately returning a single answer, a channel is opened and a result is sent to the client every time a particular event happens on the server.

A common use case for subscriptions is notifying the client side about particular events, for example the creation of a new object, when fields are updated, and many other situations…

```
subscription {
  companyAdded {
    id
    name
    brand
  } 
}

```
